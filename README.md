## TASK DESCRIPTION

The second task of my internship was to build a front-end for a real-time chat application using a modern JavaScript framework. I chose React.js for this task because of its component-based architecture, reactive state management, and real-world use in many modern chat apps. Although the task initially mentioned WebSockets, the internship instructions clarified that this was a front-end-only project, so I simulated the real-time experience instead.

The core of the project involved designing a responsive chat interface that mimics a real-time messaging environment. Users can type a message into an input field, and upon pressing send, the message is appended to the chat window instantly. To simulate a live environment, I created artificial bot replies that appear with a slight delay using JavaScript's `setTimeout()` method. The UI is styled with a Netflix-inspired dark red-and-black color palette to maintain consistency with my previous task.

React components were used to separate concerns â€” the chat messages were managed through React state using the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. The application is built to be modular and ready for WebSocket integration in the future. I created a `ChatBox` component to handle all message rendering, scrolling, and input functionality.

This task significantly deepened my understanding of React fundamentals. I learned how to manage component state, pass props, use side effects responsibly, and maintain clean separation of concerns. I also implemented auto-scroll functionality to ensure that new messages remain visible, enhancing user experience.

This chat app also includes support for keyboard input via the Enter key, real-time state updates, and simulated incoming messages. From a design perspective, the interface includes a scrollable message area and styled message bubbles to differentiate between user and bot messages. Everything is responsive and works smoothly on different screen sizes.

Overall, Task 2 was an important step in moving from basic HTML/CSS/JS to using component-based front-end frameworks. I now feel much more confident working with React, managing UI state, and building scalable UI components for real-world apps. The chat app is a fully functional and polished piece of front-end work that reflects the key skills of a frontend developer.
